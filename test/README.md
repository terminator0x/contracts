# Plexus Smart Contracts Tests

The testing for the plexus contracts is done using [Hardhat via a mainnet fork](https://hardhat.org/guides/mainnet-forking.html).

## Configuration

Before you run the tests, you need to configure the project correctly by doing the following,

1. Create a new [Alchemy Account](https://alchemyapi.io) if you already don't have one.
2. Rename the `.env_sample` file to `.env` and set the `ALCHEMY_MAINNET_URL` variable to the mainnet url in your alchemy account above.
3. You can also optionally replace the mainnet token addresses for the ERC20 tokens we're testing against, if they have changed for the ones now set in the nw `.env` file.

## Run The Tests

To run the tests, make sure you install the latest version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

Then install the required node dependencies i.e. `yarn install` and then finally run the tests via the command 

Finally run the tests as follows:

1. To run all tests, run the command `yarn test`
2. To run a specific test, run a test command specifying the path to the test i.e. `yarn test 1_deployment.js`
3. You can also check for test coverage via the command `yarn coverage`

### Test Setup

The plexus contracts should be deployed in the following order,

1. `wrapper.sol`
2. `tokenrewards.sol` 
3. `oracle.sol` 
4. `tier1Staking.sol` 
5. `core.sol` 
6. Finally after all the above contracts have been deployed, you can deploy the specific farming `tier2....` contractss i.e. `tier2Aave.sol`, `tier2Farm.sol` e.t.c
    - For example the `tier2Farm.sol` contract could be deployed, so that users can send tokens to the contract for Harvest.Finance farming e.t.c

### Transactions

After deploying the contracts, run these transactions to setup the plexus eco-system

1. Call the function `updateOracleAddress` in `tokenrewards.sol` and with the address of the `oracle.sol` contract.
2. Call the function `updateRewardAddress` in `oracle.sol` and with the address of the `tokenrewards.sol` contract.
3. Call the function `updateCoreAddress` in `oracle.sol` and with the address of the `core.sol` contract.
4. Call the function `setOracleAddress` in `core.sol` and then set it to the address of the `oracle.sol` contract.
5. Call the function `setStakingAddress` in `core.sol` and then set it to the address of the `tier1Staking.sol` contract.
6. Call the function `setConverterAddress` in `core.sol` and then set it to the address of the `wrapper.sol` contract.
7. Call the function `updateOracleAddress` in `tier1Staking.sol` and with the address of the `oracle.sol` contract.
8. Call the function `addOrEditTier2ChildStakingContract` in `tier1Staking.sol` and with the address of the `tier2Farm.sol` contract.
